Sources for my resume one-pager. Printable!

Theme used is a fork of [almeida-cv](https://github.com/ineesalmeida/almeida-cv) with minor changes for my convenience. Kudos to InÃªs for creating the theme!
I also used colors for the resume from base16 framework color scheme [base16-classic-scheme](https://github.com/detly/base16-classic-scheme). Thanks Jason Heeris for creating such nice theme.
